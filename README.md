# Work Description
Refactoring website for a marketing agency named Horiseon. The work done on the webpage was to make the previous code easier to follow and adding accessibility for future users. Also my work did not change the way the page looked, only the code was restructured.  

## Code That Was Fixed
* Added a more descriptive title to tab
* Added semantic tags to further organize website flow
* Added alt-text to images for better accessibility for people with disabilities
* Removed repetitive CSS and added specific selectors
* Re-organized css to better match sections in html
* Fixed links on header of website to connect to correct parts of website
* Commented in HTML to make code easier to understand for future collegues
